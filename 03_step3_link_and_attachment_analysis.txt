hxxps://ulyspaiement.com/secure-login
(“hxxps” used to prevent accidental clicks)

1. Link Inspection
Domain: ulyspaiement.com

Path: /secure-login
Suggests a fake login page to steal credentials.

Protocol: HTTPS — attackers often use HTTPS to look legitimate.

First seen: Step 1 confirmed it’s newly registered on Aug 8, 2025.

Hosting: IP in 223.29.226.x range, same as the sending mail server in Step 2.

WHOIS details: Registered with NameSilo, LLC, no organization name, DNS servers from dnsowl.com (often used in malicious domains).

2. Hidden Redirect Check
Attackers sometimes hide their true phishing site behind a shortened URL (e.g., bit.ly) or redirect chain.

In this case, domain is directly visible — no shorteners — but the real login form is hosted on the same domain, making it easier for users to trust.

3. Attachment Analysis
Attachments: None found in this phishing email.

Many phishing emails use .html, .pdf, or .docx files containing links or embedded forms.

This one relies solely on the malicious URL in the email body.

4. Mismatched URL
Visible link in the email body might be disguised as https://paypal.com/secure but actually point to https://ulyspaiement.com/secure-login.

Hover-over test would reveal the mismatch.

Conclusion:
The phishing link leads directly to a fraudulent login page hosted on a newly registered domain tied to malicious hosting infrastructure. No attachments were used in this campaign, suggesting the attackers relied on link-based credential harvesting.
