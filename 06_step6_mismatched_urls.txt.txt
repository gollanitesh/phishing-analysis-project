1. Observed Link
Displayed in Email: https://www.paypal.com/secure-login (appears legitimate)

Actual Link on Hover: https://ulyspaiement.com/secure-login (malicious)

2. Why This is Suspicious
The domain ulyspaiement.com is not owned by PayPal.

In Step 1, it was confirmed as a newly registered domain used for phishing.

Mismatched links are a core phishing tactic — they exploit trust in a brand name while sending users to an attacker-controlled site.

3. Risk
Clicking the link could lead to a credential harvesting page or trigger malware downloads.

Since the page likely mimics PayPal’s login, victims may enter real credentials.

Conclusion:
The email contains a deceptive link that misleads recipients into thinking they are visiting PayPal, while actually directing them to a confirmed phishing site.
