Received: from unknown123.host.com (223.29.226.45) by smtp.mailserver.com
SPF: FAIL (sender IP is not authorized to send for paypa1.com)
DKIM: FAIL
DMARC: FAIL



Analysis of Sender Address & Headers
1.Sender Address Spoofing

Domain is paypa1.com (uses digit “1” instead of letter “l” to impersonate PayPal).This is a typosquatted domain designed to fool users.

2.Urgent / Threatening Language

Email demands action within 24 hours and threatens account suspension.
Common phishing tactic to pressure the recipient into clicking quickly.

3.Suspicious Link

Visible text appears legitimate, but the actual URL is ulyspaiement.com — unrelated to PayPal.
Domain was confirmed in Step 1 to be phishing and newly registered.

4.SPF/DKIM/DMARC Failures

SPF FAIL — IP address not authorized to send email for paypa1.com.
DKIM FAIL — Message not cryptographically signed by PayPal’s legitimate domain.
DMARC FAIL — Domain’s anti-spoofing policy not followed.

5.IP Connection to Hosting

Header shows originating IP in the same 223.29.226.x range as phishing site’s hosting network (AS213441 SLAYER-AS, GB).


conclusion: 
The sender address is clearly spoofed, technical authentication checks fail, and the originating server is linked to the same infrastructure hosting the phishing site. This confirms the email is fraudulent.
