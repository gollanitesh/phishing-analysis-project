Urgent or Threatening Language Analysis
1. Text Extracted from Email Body
"We noticed suspicious activity in your PayPal account.
To restore your account access, please verify your identity immediately.
Failure to act within 24 hours will result in account suspension."

2. Identified Manipulation Techniques
a. Urgency / Time Pressure

“Failure to act within 24 hours” forces the recipient to act quickly without thinking or verifying the legitimacy of the message.

Creates a false deadline that pushes users to click the malicious link.

b. Threat of Negative Consequences

“Your account has been restricted” and “account suspension” are threats designed to create anxiety and fear of losing access to funds.

Fear-based triggers make victims more likely to follow instructions.

c. Authority Impersonation

Email pretends to be from PayPal Security Team, leveraging trust in a well-known brand.

Recipients are more likely to comply when they believe instructions come from a legitimate authority.

3. Why This Works in Phishing
People respond faster to fear than to logic when under time pressure.

The combination of a trusted brand, immediate action requirement, and threat of loss is a proven social engineering tactic.

This prevents victims from performing normal safety checks like verifying the sender or inspecting the link.


Conclusion:
The email uses classic phishing language — urgent action, account restriction threats, and brand impersonation — to psychologically manipulate the target into clicking the malicious link without hesitation.
